This repository holds Swagger API descriptions for various APIs. Don't feel like you need to put your swagger description in this repository if you don't want to - you can keep it closer to your code if you prefer. 

If you want to view a swagger doc in a format that's prettier than json/yaml, you can load it in to the Swagger UI with very little fuss.
A hosted copy of Swagger UI is available here: http://petstore.swagger.io/
In the URL field, enter the 'raw' URL of the swagger file e.g.: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v2.0/yaml/petstore-expanded.yaml`
