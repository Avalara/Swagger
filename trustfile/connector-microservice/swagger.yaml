  title: TrustFile Connector Management API
  description: |
    All custom integration / ETL ought to behave/operate in the exact same way. Adhering to this documentation will allow this

    #### Tokens:
    * connectorToTFToken: identifies the connector and restricts access to environments / version of TF API the connector is certified for (see below for token usage in header)
    * TFToConnectorToken: authorizes Trustfile to access operate the connector micro-service API
    * connectionId: identifies and authorizes access to the TF company to push data into. Mapped to a UUID Company Token in database

    #### Connector Management API responsibility
     * Integrating with TF Items API
     * Integrating with host system API, including authorization (typically something like oAuth)
     * ETL of sales/refunds/tax/shipping data into TrustFile data model
     * Basic management of user data sources:  CRUD, enable/disable/status
     * Scheduling and load balancing of users data synchronization
     * Data integrity. It is the responsibility of the connector micro-service to know what data has been processed by TrustFile.

    #### Connector Management API is not responsible for
     * User experience
     * Branding of experience (aside from the popup for authentication with host system)

    #### Hosting / Language
    * All connectors will be hosted and operated from the Heroku PaaS
    * Language: choose between - Ruby/Node/Java
    * DB: Postgres (on heroku)

    #### Dates and Timestamps
    * Dates are in yyyy-mm-dd format
    * Timestamps are in the ISO format: 2015-07-06T22:26:28+00:00
    * Timestamps are in UTC +00:00 timezone

    #### Configs
    Put localization configs (specific to a given environment) into environment variables. Document the required variables in the README.md of the project. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars
    
    #### Security:
    API requests except orangez/health are authorized with Header param
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer TFToConnectorToken

                   The connectionId is used to identify the connection in the micro-service API. It's also used to authorize access to a company when posting data to Trustfile.
                   
                   The connector will synchronize all the Sales / Tax data starting from the startDate into TrustFile; then the connector will periodically synchronize this connection at least once a day
