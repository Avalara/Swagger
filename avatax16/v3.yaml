  title: AvaTax 16 API
  description: >
    ### Overview
    
    The Tax API is used to calculate tax and record transactions for tax purposes. Tax can be calculated on sales, purchases, and transfer transactions.
    
    
    There are two *record types* the Tax API manages Tax Calculation Records and Tax Transaction Records.
    
    
    When a user of the Tax API simply wants to calculate tax on a transaction, but does not intend to include that transaction in a future filing (such as for quotes or orders), they would create a "tax calculation record" by using the `/calculations` URL.
    
    
    On the other hand, if a user wants to calculate tax on a transaction to include in a future filing (such as for invoices), they would create a "tax transaction record" by using the /transactions URL.
    
    
    The request message format, called a `TaxDocument`, is identical for both tax calculation records and tax transaction records except that `documentCode` is not required for calculations.
    
    
    The response message format is the same as the request message format except that in the case of the response message, tax information has been inserted into the message in context of where the tax applies.
    
    
    A TaxDocument captures the details of a transaction. 

    ### Authentication
    
    The Authorization header is used to identify the actor (person or system) making the request. The value is of the format `AvalaraAuth {accessKey)`, where access info is the generated access key for the actor making the call. An Access Key can be generated through the Customer Portal.


    For example: `Authorization:  AvalaraAuth MmVhZDk4YzEtZWNiZi00NzA4LThkODYtYjAxYWY4YmMxM2U1`

      summary: Create a Transaction from a Calculation
      description: >
        It may sometimes be convenient to create a tax transaction record directly from a previous tax calculation record. Perhaps an unchanged order is now to be invoiced, for example. 
        
        Tax transaction records can be created from tax calculation records either with a recalculation of the tax (this should be the most common situation) or without recalculation of the tax (this is unusual).

       The address to use for generating tax transaction records. Tax transaction records are meant to be used to calculate tax for inclusion in client system transaction documents. Tax transaction records can be retrieved later to assist with tax remittance and reconciliation.
       
       To simply calculate tax associated with a transaction, use /calculations instead.
       
       To generate a tax transaction record, AvaTax requires a tax document in a JSON element in the request body
       
       A POST to /transactions always recalculates the tax using the information in the request.

       If there is no tax transaction record with the combination of accountId, companyCode and documentCode already in the tax transaction record DB for this account, it will be created and the call will return 201.

       If there is a tax transaction record with the combination of accountId, companyCode and documentCode already in the tax transaction record DB for this account, it will be updated and the call will return 200.
       
       A POST to https://tax.api.avalara.com/transactions is really shorthand for a POST to https://tax.api.avalara.com/transactions/account/ _accountId_ /company/ _companyCode_ / _documentCode_ /versions where _accountId_, _companyCode_ and _documentCode_ are the respective values from the request body and will always (subject to passing error checking) result in a new version of the tax transaction record being created at that location.

      summary: Change a Transaction State
      description: >
       Tax transaction record states are managed by the Avalara services. Certain events may cause transitions between the states. The state of a tax transaction record affects whether it is included in tax filing and whether it can be modified.
       
       Transactions can be in one of five states -
       
       - Recorded - Transactions in this state have been recorded in the Avalara system. They can be edited. They should be included in an upcoming tax filing.
       - Voided - Transactions in this state have been recorded in the Avalara system. They cannot be edited. They will not be included in tax filing.
       - Reconciled - Transactions in this state have been recorded in the Avalara system. They cannot be edited. They are likely to be included in a tax filing shortly.
       - Filed - Transactions in this state have been recorded in the Avalara system. They cannot be edited. They are likely to have been included in a tax filing by the client systems.
       - FiledByAvalara - Transactions in this state have been recorded in the Avalara system. They cannot be edited. They have been included in a tax filing by Avalara systems.
       
       The States API is used to record significant events associated with state transitions of the tax transaction record.
       
       Supported events are -
       
       - Voided - Send this event to a Recorded tax transaction record to mark it as voided.
       - UnVoided - Send this event to a Voided tax transaction record to mark it as recorded.       
       - Reconciled - Send this event to a Recorded tax transaction record to indicate that it has been reconciled with client systems and to prevent it from being edited prior to filing. This is useful when a transaction will be filed and you do not want it to change again to facilitate auditing and reconciliation.
       - UnReconciled - Send this event to a Reconciled tax transaction record to indicate that it has not been reconciled and may need to be edited. This is useful when a Tax transaction was erroniously put into the reconciled state.
       - Filed - Send this event to a Reconciled transaction to indicate that it has been part of a tax filing by the client system. 
       - UnFiled - Send this event to a Filed transaction to indicate that it has NOT been part of a tax filing by the client system.
       - FiledbyAvalara - his event can only be sent by Avalara

      To calculate tax, the tax calculation engine needs to know about the location of the transaction. Sometimes determining these locations is straight forward, as in the case of an item purchased in person at a retail store for immediate consumption (a single POS address would suffice to indicate the origin and destination of the transaction). Other cases are only slightly more complicated, such as when a product is purchased over the phone and shipped from a warehouse to the customer\'s house. Exactly which locations are required for a given transaction depends on the context of transaction. Specifically, such things as the transactionType, avalaraGoodsAndServicesType, and applicable jurisdictions may influence what location information is required in order to calculate tax. In the case where more than one location of a given category (origin/destination) is associated with a line, the jurisdiction will determine which location is used, and this will be indicated in the calculation response. The locations can be associated at the line level or the line can inherit the location from the header. While no single location property is required, at least one location must be provided for a calculation.
