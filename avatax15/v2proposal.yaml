  description: "This is a proposal for a v2 of the AvaTax REST API. This is a DESIGN DOCUMENT ONLY and is not intended to be used, since this API DOES NOT EXIST. 
    
    * All resources below map DIRECTLY to A16 resources. The request and response payloads are almost identical in format (but favor the flatter A15 style as opposed to the more nested A16 style), with allowances made for the different structures of A15 and A16. 
    
    * Existing field names from AvaTax 15 are used.  This is a better than renaming things in A16 terminology that are not consistent with the existing db, API, documentation, and most importantly customer understanding (particularly for TaxSvc (here there's already a pretty detailed and complex conversation with customers). Some parameters have refactored from request body to path: CompanyCode, DocType, DocCode.
    
    * An address can be specified at the document/line directly (as opposed to the current AddressCode/OriginCode method). This is reflected in the Document format below. This follows the A16 model.
    
    * I'd like to add a feature where you can POST .../{docCode} to amend a document - this can add line items without repeating the whole document (an oft-requested feature) and permits changing DocCode. Right now, A15 lets you change DocCode in PostTax and CommitTax. POST .../{docCode} should ALSO let you change a document state! I think this is superior to the /stateTransitions model, but in the interest of keeping this draft as close to A16 as possible, that's what is reflected here.
    
    * Right now, this document only describes basic auth. If we want token-based auth as well, that would just be an additional security scheme.

You'll notice that there is no `company` or `account` path segment here - the calculation returned should be generic independent of account.
