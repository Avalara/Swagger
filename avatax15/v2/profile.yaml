info:
  description: "This is a proposal for a v2 of the AvaTax REST API. This is a DESIGN DOCUMENT ONLY and is not intended to be used, since this API DOES NOT EXIST. 
    
    * All resources below map DIRECTLY to A16 resources. The request and response payloads are almost identical in format (but favor the flatter A15 style as opposed to the more nested A16 style), with allowances made for the different structures of A15 and A16. 

    * This API is specific to company profile operations. For identity-based operations, see the identity API. For information about subscriptions and billing, internal applications should use the ZTB API.

    * Right now, this document only describes basic auth. If we want token-based auth as well, that would just be an additional security scheme.
